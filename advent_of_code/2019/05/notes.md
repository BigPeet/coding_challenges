This task builds upon the "intcode" implementation from Day 2.
For this reason, I've copied the Day 2 implementation as starting point for this Task.

The next step is to update the code to support the new changes, i.e. parameter modes and different instruction lengths, without adding new functionality.
After that, the new operations and new parameter modes are introduced (and parsing them).
