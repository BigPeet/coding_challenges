Most of the days are solved using C, some few exceptions are done in Python.
CMake is used as a build system.

Some scripts are used for convenience:

* make.sh: Create a build directory, configure and build with cmake.
* run.sh: Execute the binary with the provided input.
* clean.sh: Remove any build artifacts.
