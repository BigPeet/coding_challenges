General note:

To reduce the amount of time spent on these tasks, I will reduce the "overhead" a little bit.

This means that I only do input checks for example in "public" functions, not static ones.
I assume a static function is only called with already checked input.

Additionally I might move reading the input outside of C.
Reading and parsing text is not the interesting part of these tasks, but they take me a lot of time.
I might switch to either using bash or python to parse the input into command line arguments for the C executeable.
