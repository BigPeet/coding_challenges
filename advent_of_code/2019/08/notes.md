For some reason I've gotten an incomplete file when trying to Copy+Paste.
I still passed the first part, since the first 70 something layers were fine and the solution was in the 6th layer.

But I spent a lot of extra time on the 2nd part to find my error before realizing my input was corrupted.

* First Solution: 2318
* Second Solution: AHFCB
