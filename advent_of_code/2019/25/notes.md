This seems to be very similar to other ASCII problems, e.g. Day 21.
But this problem seems to rely more on an "interactive" approach to find the solution.

So I will output the robot's text to stdout and provide input via stdin.

(Maybe AFTER finding the solution I can provide hard-coded commands.)
