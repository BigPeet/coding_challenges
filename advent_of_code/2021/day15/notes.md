Well instead of just finding any path, e.g. with DFS or BFS, this is a straight-forward shortest-path problem in a graph with weighted edges.
The "classic" Dijkstra algorithm seems to be a perfect match.
The only issue might be that the input (100x100 square) has "a lot of" nodes and edges and it might become more complex for part 2.

The solution for the first part is 390.
