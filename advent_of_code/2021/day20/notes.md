I've started with an implementation which would work for an infinite sized image, but didn't account for the first element of the algorithm to be #.
Since the last one is . it won't result in infinite lit up pixels, but it requires extra consideration.
E.g., a combined "2-step" enhancement.

The solution for the first part is 5259.

The second part was simply to let this run for more steps...
The solution for the second part is 15287.
