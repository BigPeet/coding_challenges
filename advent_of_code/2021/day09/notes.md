The solution for the first part is 633.

From the given examples for Part 2 I would assume that every basin is bordered by 9's, although that is not explicitly stated.
But I guess it can be deduced from the statement that every other number is always belonging to a single basin.

If there was a sequence like "12343..." then the basin would stop at the 4, but it would likely have to be part of another basin?
At first, I will assume that basins expand to the 9's.

Otherwise this seems like a problem that can be solved with BFS or similar search algorithms.

The solution for the second part is 1050192.
