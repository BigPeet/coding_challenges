Some initial thoughts on the problem:

- Every amphoid either does not move (already in final position and does not block anything) or at most twice.
- Where to end the first move (in the hallway) is the only decision impacting cost.
- There are natural „stops“, on the minimal path to destination.
- There are „sidesteps“, which add cost, but may be required.
- The higher-cost amphoids (D, C, ...) should move minimally. If there is a conflict/intersection with a lower-cost one, that should „side-step“ (if necessary)
- Every move has an effect on following moves. If X wants to get to its goal, Y has to move, which means Z has to move, and so on.
- Initial idea: Calculate minimal moves for the Ds. Look which requirements this creates and repeat analogously.
    - if in „neutral“ but „incorrect“ position, look at all „shortest“ paths and focus on the one with the highest cost. —> reverse build path tree

I assume the layout of the burrow is always the same, i.e. the hallway is 11 fields long and the room entrances are located on the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th field.
The only thing which is dynamic is the starting positions of the amphoids.
