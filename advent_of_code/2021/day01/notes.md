These are refreshingly easy compared to the later ones ;-)

The solution to the first part is 1233.

For the second part the difference between two "three-measurement" windows (e.g. A and B) is only the first element of the earlier window and the last of the latter window.
The other two elements are contained in both windows and are therefore not relevant for the difference.

The solution to the second part is 1275.
