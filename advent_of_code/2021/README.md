I'm starting this year's challenge while finishing up the last few challenges from 2020.

Since I'm still getting familiar with Rust, I will use it for this challenge as well.
Although I might deviate on individual days.

In general, to build and run the solution for dayXY use the following commands:

```bash
cargo build -p dayXY
cargo run --bin dayXY dayXY/input.txt [OPTIONS]
```
