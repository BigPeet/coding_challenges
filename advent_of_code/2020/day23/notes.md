The naive implementation of this task requires splitting and merging the "collection" of cups at "random" indeces.
A linked-list is theoretically suited best for this, even though I think a vector could still result in better performance.

Nonetheless I will use a LinkedList just to have used it once.

The solution for the first part is 89573246.
