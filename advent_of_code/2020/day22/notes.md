The solution for the first part is 33694.

For the second part, I would assume that the order of the cards can be uniquely identified by the score.
I'm sure there might be some collisions, but I assume these won't occur with the provided input.
So it would be sufficient to store the past scores of each deck instead of the actual deck.


The solution for the second part is 31835.
