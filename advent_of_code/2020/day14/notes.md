Since the memory in this task is relatively sparsely populated, it makes sense to use an associative container, like a map or list, instead of real contiguous memory, which could be indexed.

The solution for the first part is 7817357407588.

My implementation for the first part was sadly rather incompatible with the task for in the second part.
I could have tried to redesign everything to fit nicely together, but instead chose to implement a separate "Program" for part 2.
Maybe I will refactor this later to eliminate duplicate code.

The solution for the second part is 4335927555692.
