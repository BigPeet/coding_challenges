## Language(s)

The actual focus for most challenges is coming up with a working algorithm.
So a high-level language like Python would be well-suited and sufficient.
But I also want to use these challenges to get more practice in languages like C.
That's why the used language from challenge to challenge might vary.

## Method

* Depending on the challenge user input is read in, e.g. a string to should be deserialized into a Tree.
When implementing such functions, I will try to catch obviously malformed or wrong inputs, but will only go so far to rule out every corner case.
